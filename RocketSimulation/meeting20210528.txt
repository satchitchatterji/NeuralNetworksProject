.) [x] tare out score (r::score-50), fix target printing
.) Add comments, clean code [Satchit]
0) [x] Add fuel guage [Satchit]
1) [x] Include biases [Satchit]
2) Different crossover scenarios [Andreea]
3) Play with hyperparameters [Ruhi]
4) Random rocket/target positions at each generation [Stefania]
5) Different architectures

n) If nothing else, use this as training data for supervised model
n+1) CNN/Other NN that takes in image, outputs control

List of Hyperparameters:

- Number of rockets
- Number of generations
- Rocket::score() : distance vs velocity vs rotation importance (vs fuel?)
- ControllerNetwork::calc_fitnesses() : sigma
- ControllerNetwork::mutate_all() : rate
- ControllerNetwork::mutate_all() : sigma
- ControllerNetowrk::choose_parents() : type of crossover

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Steps for Training:

[Essentially, just run train_evolution.py]
1) Set Hyperparameters
2) train_evolution.py: set rockets, generations
3) Write log notes
4) (optional) Set rocket/target init positions
5) Run!
6) tskmgr: kill Java panel, kill background py so your computer doesn't catch on fire

Check Training:

Data always saved after the last generation of training to directory tests/

- Saved networks == "sorted_cn_list_{yearmonthdateTtime}.pickle"
- Other saves "_____{yearmonthdateTtime}.txt"
- Check best rockets:
	- show_saved_controllers.py
	- set n_rockets (number of top rockets to show)
	- Run!

- Check training scores:
	- scratchpad.py
	- For mean scores:
		-open mean_scores_{yearmonthdateTtime}.txt
	- For min scores:
		-open min_scores_{yearmonthdateTtime}.txt
